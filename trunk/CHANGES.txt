3.7.0 (2009-05-25)
------------------

- Moved the ``engine`` module and associated testing machinery to
  ``zope.pagetemplate`` (version 3.5.0).

3.6.0 (2009-05-18)
------------------

* Moved ``namedtemplate.*`` from ``zope.formlib`` here as it is more
  about a page template engine than a formular library. This also
  breaks some dependencies on ``zope.formlib``.

* Added doctests to long_description to show up on pypi.

3.5.0 (2009-02-01)
------------------

* Use ``zope.container`` instead of ``zope.app.container``.

3.4.1 (2008-07-30)
------------------

* Substitute zope.app.zapi by direct calls to its wrapped apis.
  See http://launchpad.net/bugs/219302

* Fix deprecation warning in ftesting.zcml: ZopeSecurityPolicy now lives in
  zope.securitypolicy.

3.4.0 (2007-09-28)
------------------

* Initial release as standalone package.

* Dependency on zope.app.interpreter moved to an extra
  [inline-evaluation].  It is only needed by zope.app.pythonpage,
  which is an oddity.
